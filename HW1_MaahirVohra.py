If you leave out 1 or both parenthesis you get a syntax error.
Ex) SyntaxError: '(' was never closed

#2
If you leave out 1 quotation mark or both you'll get a syntax error.
If you want to print a variable out, you can use the print statement without any quotes.

#3
Putting a plus sign before a positive number doesn't change anything
Doing 2++2 doesn't change the addition, but you may get an error

#4
Putting a leading zero will cause a syntax error. 
Leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted

'''
#1
To calculate how many seconds there are, you do (minutes * 60) + seconds.
In this case it would be (42 * 60) + 42 = 2562 seconds

#2
To convert kilometers to miles. You do (kilometers / 1.61)
In this case it would be (10 / 1.61) = 6.21 miles

'''
#1
42 = n is not legal. The variable is supposed to come first. You will get a syntax error.

#2
Yes, it is legal. You are setting both x and y = 1

#3
The program will still run on VSCode if you put a semicolon at the end of a python statement.
You may get a syntax error because a semicolon does not go there.

#4
You get a syntax error saying invalid syntax

#5
You will get a Name Error. If you put x and y together with no spaces, python will look for the variable xy instead of doing x * y.

'''
#1
If volume = (4/3) * pi * r^3
r = 5, then volume = (4/3) * pi * 5^3
therefore, volume = 523.6

#2
cover price = 24.95
bookStorePrice = 14.97
shipping = 3 + 44.25 = 47.25
total cost = (bookStorePrice * 60) + shipping = $945.45

#3
easyPace = 8:15
tempo = 7:12
startTime = 6:52
So, startTime + easyPace + (3 * tempo) + easyPace
You will get home at 7:50 and 6 seconds for breakfast
